//##### Practice attentive listening and intentional clarifying questions: #####

// I have show that I have practiced attentive listening during class when we were 
// discussing setting up server side test routes and I enquired to why we were using 
// these options to view errors:

// console.log(err) - a way of handling an error, what we are going to do with it

// console.error(err) - a way of handling an error, what we are going to do with it

// if (err) return callback(err) - async operations, use the err first pattern of completing operations

// throw new Error  - stops program and finds a catch to execute, delivers the error synchronously

// - catch(err) - required if an err is ‘thrown’ otherwise the process will exit and server will restart (crash).

// This was clarified for me when we had a discussion on errors and the situations such 
// as functions, async functions and Promises which all affect what syntax we use in error situations.
